# Commitedly Stupid

## 1. I'm having trouble remembering all of these git commands. What should I do?

Google them and keep a cheat sheet!

## 2. I have a Windows machine, but I wish to code on a Linux operating system. What should I do?

Use neither! Buy a macbook :) Or install Linux from windows store and find instructions online: https://www.pcgamer.com/linux-in-windows-10/
