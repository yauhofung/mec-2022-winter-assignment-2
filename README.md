# Commitedly Stupid

## 1. I'm having trouble remembering all of these git commands. What should I do?

Google them and keep a cheat sheet!

## 2. I have a Windows machine, but I wish to code on a Linux operating system. What should I do?

You can do research on the internet for example look at videos or webpages.
