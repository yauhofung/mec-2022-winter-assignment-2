# Commitedly Stupid

## 1. I'm having trouble remembering all of these git commands. What should I do?

Google them and keep a cheat sheet!

## 2. I have a Windows machine, but I wish to code on a Linux operating system. What should I do?

DownLoad a Vitral Machine App on your PC and that way you can download serveral operating systems on it.
