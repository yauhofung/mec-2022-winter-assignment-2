# Commitedly Stupid

## 1. I'm having trouble remembering all of these git commands. What should I do?

Google them and keep a cheat sheet!

## 2. I have a Windows machine, but I wish to code on a Linux operating system. What should I do?

i will sugest to download linux on your window, because buying a new linux operating system will cost you alot of money.
